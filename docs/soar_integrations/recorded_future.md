# Recorded Future Integration

The Recorded Future integration for Chronicle SOAR allows interaction with the Recorded Future Security Intelligence Platform. This enables enriching various indicators (IPs, hashes, domains, URLs, CVEs) with threat intelligence, managing Recorded Future alerts, and adding analyst notes.

## Overview

Recorded Future provides real-time threat intelligence powered by machine learning, aggregating and analyzing data from open, closed, and technical sources. It offers context on indicators, vulnerabilities, threat actors, and attack trends.

This integration typically enables Chronicle SOAR to:

*   **Enrich Indicators:** Query Recorded Future for risk scores, related entities, threat context, and evidence for IPs, domains/hostnames, file hashes, URLs, and CVEs.
*   **Manage Alerts:** Retrieve details for specific Recorded Future alerts and update their status or assignment.
*   **Add Analyst Notes:** Add notes to entities within Recorded Future directly from SOAR.
