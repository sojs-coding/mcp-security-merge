=== AVAILABLE OPERATORS ===
• No operator = equals (default)
• ! = not equal to
• > = greater than
• >= = greater than or equal
• < = less than
• <= = less than or equal
• ~ = text match (ignores case, spaces, punctuation)
• !~ = does not text match

=== DATA TYPES & SYNTAX ===
• Strings: 'value' or ['exact_value'] for exact match
• Dates: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ' (UTC format)
• Booleans: true or false (no quotes)
• Numbers: 123 (no quotes)

=== IMPORTANT NOTES ===
• Use single quotes around string values: 'value'
• Use square brackets for exact matches and multiple values: ['value1','value2']
• Date format must be UTC: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ'
• For case-insensitive filtering, add .insensitive to field names
• Boolean values: true or false (no quotes)
• Wildcards (*) are unsupported in this API
• Some fields require specific capitalization (check individual field descriptions)

=== COMMON FILTER EXAMPLES ===
• Filter by cloud provider: cloud_provider:'aws'
• High severity vulnerabilities: severity:'HIGH'
• Recent vulnerabilities: first_seen_timestamp:>'2023-01-01'
• Filter by specific runtime: runtime:'nodejs'
• Filter by region: region:'us-east-1'
• Critical vulnerabilities in a specific account: severity:'CRITICAL'+cloud_account_id:'123456789012'
• Filter by function name: function_name:'payment-processor'
• High CVSS score vulnerabilities: cvss_base_score:>7.0
