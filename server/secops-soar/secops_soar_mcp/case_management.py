        In a SOAR context, a 'case' typically represents a security incident, investigation,
        or a container for related alerts and response actions. Listing cases provides an
        overview of ongoing or past security events being managed by the platform.
        This is useful for getting a high-level list of recent security issues or finding
        a specific incident to investigate further.

                  **Important Triage Note:** Case priority is only an initial indicator. True importance must be assessed by examining the full context (alerts, entities, potential impact, threat intelligence) using tools like `get_case_full_details`.

        **Workflow Integration:**
        - Often the FIRST step in a triage workflow to understand the current incident queue within the SOAR platform.
        - Use the output as a STARTING point, not an end, for cases needing attention.

        """Search for entities within the SOAR platform based on various criteria.

        This tool provides a flexible way to find entities (assets, users, IOCs, etc.)
        matching specific attributes. It allows searching by term (e.g., part of a hostname),
        entity type, suspicion status, asset status (internal/external), enrichment status,
        network, or environment. This is useful for exploring the entity database, finding
        potentially related entities during an investigation, or identifying assets with
        specific characteristics.

        Args:
            term (Optional[str]): A search term (e.g., partial IP, hostname fragment) to match against entity identifiers or names.
            type (Optional[List[str]]): A list of entity types to filter by (e.g., ['IP Address', 'Hostname']).
            is_suspicious (Optional[bool]): Filter for entities marked as suspicious.
            is_internal_asset (Optional[bool]): Filter for entities identified as internal assets.
            is_enriched (Optional[bool]): Filter for entities that have undergone enrichment processes.
            network_name (Optional[List[str]]): Filter entities belonging to specific networks.
            environment_name (Optional[List[str]]): Filter entities belonging to specific environments.

        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary representing the raw API response from the SOAR platform,
                  typically containing a list of entity objects matching the search criteria.

        **Workflow Integration:**
        - Useful for exploratory analysis within the SOAR platform's entity database,
          especially when you don't have a specific identifier from an alert or case.
        - Can help identify potentially related entities based on partial information or
          shared characteristics (e.g., finding all suspicious hosts in a specific environment
          as known by the SOAR).

        **Next Steps (using MCP-enabled tools):**
        - Analyze the list of returned entities.
        - Use a SOAR entity details tool (like `get_entity_details`) for more SOAR-specific information on entities found.
        - Use SIEM entity lookup tools for broader historical context on interesting entities.
        - Use threat intelligence tools to enrich findings.

        This tool provides a consolidated view of a security case by fetching its primary details
        (like status, priority, description), all linked security alerts, and the full history
        of comments added by analysts or automation. This aggregated information is essential
        for getting a complete understanding of an incident's context, scope, investigation
        progress, and collaborative notes without making multiple separate API calls.

        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary containing the aggregated results from three separate API calls:

                  - 'case_comments': The raw API response containing the list of comments for the case.
                  **Triage Note:** Use the `priority` field as an initial guide only. Analyze the combined details (alerts, comments, entities involved, potential impact, related threat intelligence) gathered by this tool and others to determine the true importance and urgency of the case.

        **Workflow Integration:**
        - A primary tool for *starting* the investigation of a specific case identified within the SOAR platform (e.g., via `list_cases`).
        - Provides a comprehensive *initial overview* by gathering core SOAR case data, associated alerts, and comments in one call. **Crucially, this is a starting point; a full investigation requires deeper analysis using subsequent tools.**

        **Next Steps (using MCP-enabled tools - Essential for Full Investigation):**
        - Analyze the `case_details` for status, priority, and description.
        - Examine `case_alerts` to understand the triggers. **Use alert event tools (like `list_events_by_alert`) for underlying event data.**
        - Review `case_comments` for analyst notes or previous actions.
        - Identify key entities from alerts or comments.
        - **Use tools to find entities associated with the case or specific alert groups within it (like `get_entities_by_alert_group_identifiers`).**
        - **Enrich findings using SIEM (`lookup_entity`, `search_security_events`), TI (`get_threat_intel`), EDR, Cloud, or other relevant security tool MCP integrations.**
        - Document investigation progress using a case commenting tool.
        - Consider adjusting case priority using a priority management tool based on findings.
