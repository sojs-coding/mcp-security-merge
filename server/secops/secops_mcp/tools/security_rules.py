    """List security detection rules configured in Chronicle SIEM.

    Retrieves the definitions of detection rules currently active or configured
    within the Chronicle SIEM instance.

    **Workflow Integration:**
    - Useful for understanding the detection capabilities currently deployed in the SIEM.
    - Can help identify the specific rule that generated a SIEM alert (obtained via SIEM alert tools
      or from case management/SOAR system details).
    - Provides context for rule tuning, development, or understanding alert logic.

    **Use Cases:**
    - Review the logic or scope of a specific detection rule identified from an alert.
    - Audit the set of active detection rules within the SIEM.
    - Understand which rules might be relevant to a particular threat scenario or TTP.

                        error structure if the API call fails.

    Next Steps (using MCP-enabled tools):

        - Correlate rule details with specific alerts retrieved from the SIEM or case management system.
        - Use insights for rule optimization, false positive analysis, or developing related detections.

    This tool fetches detections based on a rule ID, allowing for investigation
    and analysis of rule performance and threat activity.

    **Workflow Integration:**
    - **Alert Triage:** When an alert is generated by a rule, use this tool to retrieve all historical detections for that rule to understand the context and frequency.
    - **Rule Effectiveness Analysis:** Analyze the volume, timestamps, and details of detections to determine if a rule is too noisy, too quiet, or performing as expected.
    - **Threat Hunting:** If a rule is designed to detect a specific TTP or indicator, use this tool to find all instances where the rule has matched historical data.
    - **Incident Scoping:** During an incident, if a particular rule is relevant, retrieve its detections to help identify the scope and timeline of related events.
    - **Compliance Reporting:** Gather detections for specific rules related to compliance mandates over a certain period.

    **Use Cases:**
    - Retrieve all detections for a rule ID obtained from a SIEM alert or a case management system.
    - Filter detections by their alert state (e.g., "ALERTING", "NOT_ALERTING") to focus on actionable events.
    - Paginate through a large number of detections if a rule is particularly verbose.
    - Monitor the output of a newly deployed or recently modified detection rule.
    - Investigate past occurrences of a threat detected by a specific rule.
    - Assess the Alert to determine liklihood of maliciousness

    Args:
        rule_id (str): Unique ID of the rule to list detections for.
                        Examples: "ru_xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" (latest version),
                        "ru_xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx@v_12345_67890" (specific version),

        alert_state (Optional[str]): If provided, filter by alert state.
                                     Valid values: "UNSPECIFIED", "NOT_ALERTING", "ALERTING".
        page_size (Optional[int]): If provided, the maximum number of detections to return in a single response.
        page_token (Optional[str]): If provided, a token to retrieve the next page of results for pagination.
        project_id (Optional[str]): Google Cloud project ID. Defaults to environment configuration.
        customer_id (Optional[str]): Chronicle customer ID. Defaults to environment configuration.
        region (Optional[str]): Chronicle region (e.g., "us", "europe"). Defaults to environment configuration.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing the list of detections (under a 'detections' key, typically)
                        and pagination information (e.g., 'nextPageToken'). Returns an error
                        structure if the API call fails. The exact structure depends on the
                        Chronicle API version and client implementation.

    Next Steps (using MCP-enabled tools):
        - **Analyze Composite Detections:** If the CollectionElments contain additional Detection IDs, retrieve those detections and analyze the events as well
        - **Enrich Observables:** Extract indicators (IPs, domains, hashes) from the detection details or related UDM events and use threat intelligence tools for enrichment.
        - **Case Management:** If detections reveal significant activity, create or update incidents in a case management or SOAR system.
        - **Rule Tuning:** Based on the nature and volume of detections (e.g., many false positives), consider modifying the rule logic (using a hypothetical `update_rule` tool) or its alerting configuration (using `enable_rule` or similar).
        - **Retro-Hunting:** If the rule was recently updated or if you want to test variations, initiate a new retrohunt (e.g., using `create_retrohunt`).
        - **Error Checking:** If detections are missing or behavior is unexpected, check for rule execution errors (e.g., using `list_errors`).
        - **Visualize Detections:** Export detection data and use data visualization tools to identify trends or patterns over time.

        - **Modify Rule:** Correct the rule based on error messages and update it in Chronicle.
        - **Re-check Detections:** After fixing errors, use `get_rule_detections` to see if the rule now produces detections.
